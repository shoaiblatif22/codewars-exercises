## Q1 ##

Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 positive integers. No floats or non-positive integers will be passed.

For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.

[10, 343445353, 3453445, 3453545353453] should return 3453455.

## Q2 ##

Your function takes two arguments:

current father's age (years)
current age of his son (years)
Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old). The answer is always greater or equal to 0, no matter if it was in the past or it is in the future.

## Q3 ##

Rock Paper Scissors
Let's play! You have to return which player won! In case of a draw return Draw!.

Examples(Input1, Input2 --> Output):

"scissors", "paper" --> "Player 1 won!"
"scissors", "rock" --> "Player 2 won!"
"paper", "paper" --> "Draw!"

## Q4 ##

n this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.

For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.

Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.

If you can, try writing it in one line of code.

## Q5 ##

As a part of this Kata, you need to create a function that when provided with a triplet, returns the index of the numerical element that lies between the other two elements.

The input to the function will be an array of three distinct numbers (Haskell: a tuple).

For example:

gimme([2, 3, 1]) => 0

## Q6 ##
Write a function that returns a string in which firstname is swapped with last name.

Example(Input --> Output)

"john McClane" --> "McClane john"

## Q7 ##

In this kata you will create a function that takes in a list and returns a list with the reverse order.

Examples (Input -> Output)
* [1, 2, 3, 4]  -> [4, 3, 2, 1]
* [9, 2, 0, 7]  -> [7, 0, 2, 9]

## Q8 ##

Create a function called shortcut to remove the lowercase vowels (a, e, i, o, u ) in a given string.

Examples
"hello"     -->  "hll"
"codewars"  -->  "cdwrs"
"goodbye"   -->  "gdby"
"HELLO"     -->  "HELLO"

## Q9 ##

Description:
Remove an exclamation mark from the end of a string. For a beginner kata, you can assume that the input data is always a string, no need to verify it.

Examples
remove("Hi!") == "Hi"
remove("Hi!!!") == "Hi!!"
remove("!Hi") == "!Hi"
remove("!Hi!") == "!Hi"
remove("Hi! Hi!") == "Hi! Hi"
remove("Hi") == "Hi"

## Q10 ##
Bob is working as a bus driver. However, he has become extremely popular amongst the city's residents. With so many passengers wanting to get aboard his bus, he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space left on the bus! He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be able to fit all the passengers.

Task Overview:
You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:

cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.
If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.

Usage Examples:
cap = 10, on = 5, wait = 5 --> 0 # He can fit all 5 passengers
cap = 100, on = 60, wait = 50 --> 10 # He can't fit 10 of the 50 waiting

## Q11 ##

Convert number to reversed array of digits
Given a random non-negative number, you have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order.

Example(Input => Output):
35231 => [1,3,2,5,3]
0 => [0]

## Q12 ##
Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight.

Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.

Example:
h = 0
m = 1
s = 1

result = 61000

## Q13 ## 
a is considered "close to" b if margin is greater than or equal to the distance between a and b.

Please note the following:

When a is close to b, return 0.
Otherwise...

When a is less than b, return -1.

When a is greater than b, return 1.

If margin is not given, treat it as zero.

Assume: margin >= 0

Tip: Some languages have a way to make parameters optional.

Example 1
If a = 3, b = 5, and margin = 3, then close_compare(a, b, margin) should return 0.

This is because a and b are no more than 3 numbers apart.

Example 2
If a = 3, b = 5, and margin = 0, then close_compare(a, b, margin) should return -1.

This is because the distance between a and b is greater than 0, and a is less than b.
