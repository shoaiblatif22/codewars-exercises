## Q1 ##

Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 positive integers. No floats or non-positive integers will be passed.

For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.

[10, 343445353, 3453445, 3453545353453] should return 3453455.

## Q2 ##

Your function takes two arguments:

current father's age (years)
current age of his son (years)
Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old). The answer is always greater or equal to 0, no matter if it was in the past or it is in the future.

## Q3 ##

Rock Paper Scissors
Let's play! You have to return which player won! In case of a draw return Draw!.

Examples(Input1, Input2 --> Output):

"scissors", "paper" --> "Player 1 won!"
"scissors", "rock" --> "Player 2 won!"
"paper", "paper" --> "Draw!"

## Q4 ##

n this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.

For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.

Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.

If you can, try writing it in one line of code.

## Q5 ##

As a part of this Kata, you need to create a function that when provided with a triplet, returns the index of the numerical element that lies between the other two elements.

The input to the function will be an array of three distinct numbers (Haskell: a tuple).

For example:

gimme([2, 3, 1]) => 0

## Q6 ##
Write a function that returns a string in which firstname is swapped with last name.

Example(Input --> Output)

"john McClane" --> "McClane john"

## Q7 ##

In this kata you will create a function that takes in a list and returns a list with the reverse order.

Examples (Input -> Output)
* [1, 2, 3, 4]  -> [4, 3, 2, 1]
* [9, 2, 0, 7]  -> [7, 0, 2, 9]

## Q8 ##

Create a function called shortcut to remove the lowercase vowels (a, e, i, o, u ) in a given string.

Examples
"hello"     -->  "hll"
"codewars"  -->  "cdwrs"
"goodbye"   -->  "gdby"
"HELLO"     -->  "HELLO"

## Q9 ##

Description:
Remove an exclamation mark from the end of a string. For a beginner kata, you can assume that the input data is always a string, no need to verify it.

Examples
remove("Hi!") == "Hi"
remove("Hi!!!") == "Hi!!"
remove("!Hi") == "!Hi"
remove("!Hi!") == "!Hi"
remove("Hi! Hi!") == "Hi! Hi"
remove("Hi") == "Hi"
